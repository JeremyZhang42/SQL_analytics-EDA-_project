# SQL_analytics_EDA_project

This is an extension of my previous data warehouse project. After I built the databases and tables in MySQL workbench, I then turned to a analytical direction of honing my SQL skills, which is making analysis of data using the data that I loaded into my tables! These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.
